### üîó Relationship to the Analysis Project

This web application is the final product of a comprehensive data analysis project.

* **The "How" (The Analysis):** The complete end-to-end analysis, including data cleaning, advanced NLP, and the scoring model, can be found in the [**analysis repository**](https://github.com/ricardoaugusto31/yogyakarta-coffee-shop-analysis).
* **The "What" (This App):** This repository takes the final, processed dataset from that analysis (`coffee_shop_scores_final.csv`) and builds an interactive user interface on top of it.

This separation demonstrates a complete project lifecycle, from raw data processing to a polished, user-facing product.
